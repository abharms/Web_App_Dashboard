# Web_App_Dashboard

An interactive web dashboard using ChartJS. 

Alert box goes away when clicking the X.

Left menu items are clickable and highlight when current one is selected.

Hamburger menu icon appears for mobile devices and user can click to reveal menu.

User can search for members records in the Message User section. 
Member records are stored in a separate json file and retrieved 
via an AJAX request.

In the Settings section, a dropdown arrow appears in Chrome to select a timezone.
Currently, a user has to double click on the "Select Timezone" field in Firefox
to reveal the timezone options.

This project is still a work in progress.
